![NDC Security 2026 - MITRE ATT&CK for Developers](/images/ndc-security-2026-mitre-attck-for-developers.jpg)

I'm excited to be speaking at [NDC Security 2026](https://ndcsecurity.com/) in Oslo, March 2-5! I'll be presenting **MITRE ATT&CK for Developers** — showing how developers can go beyond the OWASP Top 10 and use the ATT&CK framework to think like attackers and build stronger defenses.

## About NDC Security

[NDC Security](https://ndcsecurity.com/) is a dedicated security conference for software developers, held at the Radisson Blu Scandinavia Hotel in Oslo. With 66 sessions and over 60 speakers, it bridges the gap between development and security — designed for developers who want to build secure software and security professionals who want to understand modern development practices.

This year features an all-new **OWASP x NDC Security** track, bringing OWASP content directly into the conference lineup.

## My Talk: MITRE ATT&CK for Developers

**Wednesday, March 4 at 10:20 — Room 3**

Most developers know the OWASP Top 10, but fewer know the MITRE ATT&CK framework. In this talk, I'll cover how ATT&CK complements OWASP, walk through real attack chains with code examples in Python, C#, and JavaScript, and show practical detection patterns you can implement in your applications. The goal: think like an attacker, build like a defender.

For a preview, check out my blog post on [MITRE ATT&CK for Developers: Beyond OWASP](/posts/mitre-attack-framework/).

## Conference Highlights

### Keynote

**Michael Howard** opens the conference with **25 Years of the Microsoft SDL** — a look back at how the Security Development Lifecycle has shaped how we build secure software.
