I'm excited to preview my upcoming NDC Oslo talk, **"Resilient by Design"**, where I'll share how to architect Azure systems that not only survive failure but continue running smoothly when disruptions occur ([NDC][1]). Join me on to explore core resilience principles, Azure-native tools, and proven best practices for maintaining high availability in real-world scenarios ([Microsoft Azure][2], [Microsoft Learn][3]). Whether you're new to Azure or looking to optimize an existing environment, this session will equip you with actionable strategies to anticipate, mitigate, and recover from failures ([Microsoft Learn][4]).

## Why Resilience Matters

In cloud-native environments, **failure is inevitable**-hardware degrades, networks fluctuate, dependencies falter-and without resilience built in, even minor glitches can cascade into major outages ([Microsoft Azure][2], [Azure Well-Architected][8]). Designing for resilience means embracing failure modes and planning recovery paths proactively rather than reacting when things break ([Microsoft Learn][3], [Azure Well-Architected][8]). By prioritizing resilience, organizations can uphold service-level objectives (SLOs) and deliver reliable experiences to users, even under adverse conditions ([Microsoft Learn][4], [Azure Well-Architected][8]).

## Core Resilience Principles

- **Design for Redundancy:** Build duplicate components and failover paths to eliminate single points of failure, leveraging availability zones and regions as your foundation ([Microsoft Learn][3], [Azure Well-Architected][8]).
- **Implement Multi-Region Strategies:** Use active-active or active-passive architectures across regions to maintain service continuity during regional outages ([Microsoft Learn][4], [Azure Well-Architected][8]).
- **Leverage Failure Mode Analysis:** Proactively identify and prioritize potential failure scenarios to focus mitigation efforts where they matter most ([Microsoft Learn][3], [Azure Well-Architected][8]).
- **Plan for Geo-Redundancy:** Configure geo-redundant storage and services (e.g., GRS/RA-GRS) to ensure critical data remains accessible if a primary region becomes unavailable ([Azure documentation][5], [Azure Well-Architected][8]).

## Azure Resilience Toolkit

- **Azure Chaos Studio:** Inject controlled faults to validate and harden your applications against real-world issues before they impact customers ([Azure Chaos Studio][6]).
- **Traffic Management & Load Balancing:** Use Azure Traffic Manager and Front Door to intelligently route traffic and failover quickly under load spikes or regional failures ([Microsoft Learn][7], [Azure Well-Architected][8]).
- **App Service Reliable Web App Pattern:** Implement retry, circuit breaker, and cache-aside patterns to improve application reliability and performance efficiency ([Microsoft Learn][7], [Azure Well-Architected][8]).
- **Well-Architected Framework:** Apply the Reliability pillar's design principles and assessment checklists from Microsoft's Well-Architected Framework to ensure consistent resilience across workloads ([Azure Well-Architected][8]).

## Real-World Strategies

We'll cover **real-world strategies** for maintaining uptime under pressure, such as automated failover drills, disaster recovery runbooks, and self-healing infrastructure practices ([NDC][1]). You'll see examples of how teams integrate chaos experiments into CI/CD pipelines and leverage telemetry-driven insights to continuously refine their resilience posture ([Azure Chaos Studio][6], [Azure Well-Architected][8]).

## Join Me in Oslo!

I look forward to meeting you and diving into the art and science of building **resilient-by-design** solutions in Azure. Don't miss this chance to level up your resilience strategy-see you at **NDC Oslo!**
