I'm thrilled to share that I've been promoted to **Principal Software Engineer** at Microsoft!

## The Journey

It's been an incredible four and a half years at Microsoft, and this milestone still feels a bit surreal. When I [joined Microsoft in October 2021](/posts/time-to-follow-my-dream-im-joining-microsoft/) as a Senior Customer Engineer on the Fast Track for Azure (FTA) team, I was living a dream I'd had since childhood. I never imagined the journey would bring me here.

During my time on the FTA team, I worked directly with customers adopting Azure, helping them architect and build cloud-native solutions. It was an amazing experience - every engagement brought new challenges, new architectures, and new opportunities to learn and teach.

In late 2024, I [moved to the Azure Reliability (AzRel) Risk SRE team](/posts/new-team-new-focus/), a shift that pushed me into entirely new territory. As the lead for the Platform Reliability Pillar, I dove into outage analysis, building AI-driven tooling with OpenAI and Semantic Kernel to help engineers understand failures and strengthen Azure's reliability at scale. It was a big change, but it reinforced something I've always believed - growth comes from stepping into the unfamiliar.

## Looking Forward

As a Principal Software Engineer, I'm continuing to focus on Azure reliability - building tools and systems that help keep the platform running smoothly for millions of users worldwide. I'm also doubling down on the things I'm passionate about:

- **Building** - AI-powered tooling for reliability engineering, distributed systems, and cloud-native applications
- **Speaking** - sharing what I've learned at conferences around the world, from NDC and Techorama to DevSum and Aspire Conf
- **Community** - organizing DevOps Days Tampa Bay, mentoring, and contributing to open source
- **Writing** - more blog posts, more samples, more sharing

## Gratitude

None of this happens alone. I'm grateful for the incredible teammates and mentors I've had on both teams, the managers who championed my growth, and the community that keeps pushing me to learn and share. And of course, my family - who support all the late nights, conference travel, and the constant tinkering.

If you're on your own career journey, here's what I'd say: don't be afraid to take the leap into unfamiliar territory. The skills you've built are more transferable than you think, and the best growth happens outside your comfort zone. I gave a [whole talk about this](/speaking/) - *Refactoring Your Technical Identity* - and I truly believe it.

Here's to the next chapter. Let's build something great.
