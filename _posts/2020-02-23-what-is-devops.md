### What _Isn’t_ DevOps?

Before I define DevOps, let’s get started with what DevOps isn’t. DevOps isn’t just a title, or a guy, or a department. DevOps isn’t just automating everying, and isn’t just logging everything. DevOps isn’t dozens of alerts every day, and isn’t an on-call rotation. DevOps isn’t agile or small releases. DevOps is a mindset.

### What _Is_ DevOps?

The best definition I’ve seen is from [Donovan Brown](http://donovanbrown.com/post/what-is-devops), "DevOps is the union of **People**, **Processes**, and **Products** to _continuously deliver **value**_ to our end users". Donovan breaks down his word choice and what it means to him. To me, DevOps is a mindset that should be adopted company wide. Because of delivering value to our end users, you need a Production-First mindset. It’s not about delivering story points, delivering user stories, or deploying to qa.

### Half Measures

Have you ever been at a company that "Bought the Agile"? Doing Standups and Sprints but not understanding the why behind it. Agile is a promise of more work from fewer people, right? Have you ever heard,"Why are we doing retrospectives, that’s not a feature".

DevOps can be the same way. Perform a number of _actions_ and _activities_ but not adopt the _mindset_. **Why** are we automating things? **Why** and **what** should we log or alert on? **How** do we use this data or improve our processes and products?
