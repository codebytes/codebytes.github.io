Marp is a powerful and user-friendly presentation framework that simplifies the process of creating visually appealing slide decks using Markdown. In this blog post, we'll explore what Marp is, why you might want to use it, how to get started. I'll share my process and show you how you can automate hosting your presentations on GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.

## What is Marp?

Marp is an open-source presentation framework that allows you to create beautiful, customizable slide decks using the simplicity and flexibility of Markdown. By harnessing the power of Markdown, Marp enables you to focus on your content and message without getting bogged down in complex formatting and design choices. Marp has cli and VS Code extensions, and it supports exporting presentations to various formats, including HTML, PDF, and PowerPoint. 

## Why Use Marp?

There are several reasons why you might want to consider using Marp for your presentations:

- **Simplicity:** Marp allows you to write your presentations in plain text using the intuitive Markdown syntax, which is easy to learn and use.
- **Focus on content:** With Marp, you can concentrate on your message and content without worrying about complex formatting and design choices.
- **Customizable:** Marp offers a range of customization options, allowing you to create presentations that align with your personal style and preferences.
- **Integration with Visual Studio Code:** Marp seamlessly integrates with the popular Visual Studio Code editor, providing real-time previews and a smooth workflow for creating and editing presentations.
- **Export options:** Marp supports exporting presentations to various formats, including HTML, PDF, and PowerPoint.

## Working with Marp

For me, the ideal way to interact and work with Marp is through the [Marp for VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode). This extension provides a seamless workflow for creating and editing presentations in Visual Studio Code. It also offers real-time previews, allowing you to see your presentation as you write it. To get started, install the Marp for VS Code extension and open a new Markdown file. You can then start writing your presentation. A sample presentation is shown below:

```markdown
