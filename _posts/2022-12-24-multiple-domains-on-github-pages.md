Something I found out after moving from Wordpress to GitHub Pages is that out of the box you can only host a single domain for a repo with GitHub Pages. This means for example, I can setup www.chris-ayers.com and chris-ayers.com for my repo and nothing else.
If I want another domain to point to it, I would need to fork the repo and setup the new repo for the additional domain.
