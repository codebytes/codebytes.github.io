### Aspiring .NET with Azure Open AI and Ollama

I'm excited to present **"Aspiring .NET with Azure Open AI and Ollama"** at Techorama Belgium! This session is all about harnessing the power of AI in your .NET applications, and I can't wait to share it with you. I'll be diving into how to integrate **Azure OpenAI** and **Ollama** to create intelligent, modern .NET solutions. Expect hands-on demos, code walkthroughs, and practical advice for bringing conversational AI, LLMs, and generative capabilities into your projects. I love that Microsoft.Extensions.AI allows you to easily integrate with Azure OpenAI and Ollama, and I can't wait to show you how!

Discover how .NET developers can unlock the potential of AI in their applications! In this session, I'll demonstrate how to integrate **Azure OpenAI** and **Ollama** to build intelligent, modern .NET solutions. Expect hands-on demos, code walkthroughs, and practical advice for bringing conversational AI, LLMs, and generative capabilities into your projects.

**Key topics:**
- .NET Aspire and the future of AI
- Microsoft.Extensions.AI for seamless integration with Azure OpenAI and Ollama
- Seamless .NET integration with Azure OpenAI and Ollama
- Deploying and scaling AI-powered features in the cloud

### Resilient by Design

I'll also be delivering this session on Azure Resiliency at [NDC Oslo](/2025/05/06/ndc-oslo-2025/), and I'm excited to bring it to Techorama Belgium as well! Swing by my [Session](https://techorama.be/agenda/session/resilient-by-design/) if you're in Belgium!

#### Why Resilience Matters

In cloud-native environments, **failure is inevitable**-hardware degrades, networks fluctuate, dependencies falter-and without resilience built in, even minor glitches can cascade into major outages ([Microsoft Azure][2], [Azure Well-Architected][8]). Designing for resilience means embracing failure modes and planning recovery paths proactively rather than reacting when things break ([Microsoft Learn][3], [Azure Well-Architected][8]). By prioritizing resilience, organizations can uphold service-level objectives (SLOs) and deliver reliable experiences to users, even under adverse conditions ([Microsoft Learn][4], [Azure Well-Architected][8]).
