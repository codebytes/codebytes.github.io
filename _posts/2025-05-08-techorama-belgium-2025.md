## My Sessions at Techorama Belgium 2025

### Aspiring .NET with Azure OpenAI and Ollama

![](/assets/images/dotnet-aspire-logo.svg)

Discover how you can unlock the potential of AI in your .NET applications. In this session, you'll learn how to integrate [Azure OpenAI](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/openai-service/) and [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) to build intelligent, modern .NET solutions. Through hands-on demos, code walkthroughs, and practical guidance, you'll see how conversational AI, large language models, and generative capabilities can enhance your projects.

You'll also explore [.NET Aspire](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire/get-started/aspire-overview), a modern framework designed to simplify building cloud-native applications. .NET Aspire provides streamlined APIs, built-in observability, and simplified deployment, making it easier to develop, test, and scale your applications efficiently.

Additionally, you'll learn about [Microsoft.Extensions.AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/ai/microsoft-extensions-ai), a powerful library that integrates AI services directly into your .NET applications. It provides standardized interfaces and extensions, enabling you to easily connect to AI models like Azure OpenAI and Ollama, manage AI configurations, and incorporate advanced AI capabilities without extensive changes to your existing code.

**Key topics:**

- [.NET Aspire](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire/get-started/aspire-overview) and the future of cloud-native .NET applications
- [Microsoft.Extensions.AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/ai/microsoft-extensions-ai) for seamless integration with Azure OpenAI and Ollama
- Building AI-powered features in your .NET applications
- Deploying and scaling AI solutions in the cloud

### Resilient by Design

I'll also be delivering this session on Azure Resiliency at [NDC Oslo](/2025/05/06/ndc-oslo-2025/), and I'm excited to bring it to [Techorama Belgium](https://techorama.be/) as well!

In cloud environments, failures are inevitable. This session explores how to build systems that not only survive but thrive amid disruptions. We'll examine practical resilience patterns, architectural approaches, and Azure-native tools that help maintain reliability when components fail.

**Key topics:**

- Cloud resilience fundamentals and failure modes
- Multi-region architecture strategies
- Built-in [Azure resilience capabilities](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/well-architected/reliability/)
- Testing for resilience with [Azure Chaos Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/chaos-studio/)
- Implementing resilience patterns in .NET applications
